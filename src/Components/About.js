        <h1>Hello Internet, it's me, Christie.</h1>
        <p>I’ve eaten some strange stuff over the years, but no matter what I eat I’ll always have one true love, instant ramen. For some, instant ramen is a staple that is eaten due to the inability to cook or care. For me instant ramen is a luxury. With its high sodium content and low nutritional value, I can’t justify eating it regularly, so every opportunity must be exquisite. Some of you are probably thinking that I am just a basic white girl who has overhyped this low quality food. But my love for ramen runs deeper. </p>
        <p>Regular ramen is great too, but thanks to google everyone and their mom can find the best ramen restaurants with a couple tried. Instant ramen is a bit more complicated, the flavors more complex and the health benefits significantly lower. With that in mind this site will mostly be dedicated to topics surrounding instant ramen.  </p>
